# ITEC324_Project1
## A java implementation of the first programming assignment for ITEC 324 => implementing a simple vending machine.
### Background
This program creates a vending machine, allowing users to *purchase* products. 
It is designed using Swing to create a GUI to allow for better control.
By controlling what the user can interact with and input, I've increased the security of the software; All decisions are predetermined.

***//TODO: Allow the admin to add/remove products and change product prices.***
